# `@solana/wallet-adapter-fake`

This is the default wallet adapter used in the starter packs. This wallet adapter plugin implements the interface, but does not actually sign or send messages.

See https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter#usage for an example of how to configure your app for compatibility with a list of wallets of your choosing.
